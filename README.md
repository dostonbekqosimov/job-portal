## Job Portal

Job Portal is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate job posting and management. It is built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. This platform allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for job posts.

### Features

- **Job Post Management**: Users can perform CRUD operations for job posts, including creating new posts, viewing existing posts, updating post details, and deleting posts.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access and manage job posts.
- **Responsive UI**: The frontend is built using React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Backend API**: The Spring Boot backend provides RESTful APIs to handle requests from the frontend, facilitating data retrieval, manipulation, and persistence.
- **Database Integration**: The application integrates with a PostgreSQL database to store and manage job post data efficiently.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Build Tool**: Maven

### Backend Details

- **Spring Data JPA**: The backend utilizes Spring Data JPA for simplified data access and persistence. It provides repositories with CRUD methods out of the box, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing productivity.
- **Database Connection**: The backend connects to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC. The database configuration can be found in `src/main/resources/application.properties`, where you can customize the connection URL, username, password, etc.

### Frontend-Backend Communication

- **RESTful API**: The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs. Endpoints for job post management are defined in the backend and accessed by the frontend using Axios or similar HTTP client libraries.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: CORS is configured in the backend to allow requests from the frontend, ensuring seamless communication between the two layers.

### Usage

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JobApp.git
